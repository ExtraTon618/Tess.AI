Privacy Policy for Tess.AI
Effective Date: 2025-06-05

Tess.AI (“the App”) is developed and owned by Gopal Anantharaman under Knot Theory.ai.

1. Data Collection
The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data. No user content is sent to external servers or services.

2. Local Data Storage
All data — including voice prompts, preferences, and configuration files — is stored locally on the user's device. The App adheres strictly to the macOS sandbox environment.

3. No Third-Party Tracking
Tess.AI does not use third-party analytics, tracking SDKs, advertising frameworks, or telemetry systems.

4. Microphone Access
The App accesses your microphone only when explicitly triggered (e.g., during voice input). Audio is processed entirely on-device.

5. User Consent
Because Tess.AI does not share or collect user data, no additional user consent is required beyond what macOS provides (e.g., system microphone access prompt).

6. Compliance
Tess.AI complies with all Apple App Store Review Guidelines and follows macOS sandbox security best practices.
